    "content": "In any community, especially our own at *STEM High School for Boys – 6th of October*, leadership is a powerful force. We see students aspiring to lead everywhere – in non-profit teams, in clubs, on student councils, or even in capstone teams, whether to make a real impact, stand out. Some are drawn to the *idea* of leadership, seeking its *aura* without necessarily embracing its responsibilities, others see it as a strategic step for boosting college applications. Yet, beneath these varied aspirations, a critical question remains unasked: *How do we truly understand and value leadership? What hidden needs does it sometimes fill within us? How does one's perception of themselves and others shift when they gain influence, seemingly convinced they are now at the center of the universe?*\n\n## The CHARACTER:\n\nFor this discussion, we'll explore these dynamics through the lens of **Hisoka Morow**—a fictional character from HunterxHunter, chosen to embody certain qualities and behaviors associated with leadership.\n\n## The MASK:\n\nHisoka, at first, was simply another student among his peers—talkative, witty, but all in all, just an ordinary guy, yet deep down; beneath that charm, there's more. Deep inside, Hisoka was uncertain of himself. They might feel good, but never truly the best; smart, but never the smartest. Gifted, but never truly exceptional. They felt like they were always one step behind the people who naturally stood out, and that feeling kept eating him from the inside out.\n\nHisoka, despite his achievements, constantly feels overlooked or not quite *enough* in academic discussions. They might crave recognition, not for the joy of contribution, but to silence that nagging doubt. So, when a leadership opportunity arises–perhaps a club presidency or a project lead–they see it as their golden ticket, believing the title itself will finally make them feel secure and respected.\n\nFor them, leadership becomes more than just a role; it's a **mask**. It's a way to hide his insecurities, to compensate for perceived weaknesses, and to project an illusion of competence. They truly believe that if others see them as powerful, they will finally feel secure. *But does this external power, this title, ever truly fill that internal void?*\n\n*\"This approach treats leadership as a facade, a means to cover internal doubts rather than a genuine commitment to service.\"*\n\n## The LEADERBOARD:\n\nHisoka views school life as a grand, competitive **leaderboard**. Every club, every committee, every position wasn't just an opportunity to serve, but a rank to be climbed, a score to be displayed. He saw the entire student body as a hierarchy where a title signifies success. For them, leadership isn't about the work; it's about the *win*, about having the highest score. They might see the President of the Student Council not as a facilitator of student voice, but as the player with the most points. They *believe* that being at the top of this perceived leaderboard is the ultimate measure of worth.\n\nThis mentality shifted his entire worldview. The moment he stepped into a leadership position, it was as if something inside him switched. The way he spoke changed. The way he looked at people shifted. Those who were once his equals were now beneath him, and he made sure they felt it. One day, when asked if he was attending an event, Hisoka smiled and declared, \"I am going, but not like you. I will go as an upper hand, as a leader.\" His tone made it clear—he saw us as beneath him now. This wasn't about attending an event; it was about proving that he was different, that he was somehow above the rest of us on the \"board.\"\n\nAnother time, when friends needed information about an upcoming school initiative that Hisoka, now in the \"leadership circle,\" had access to, he smirked and said, \"This info is for the leaders only. You guys don't really need to know, and if you need, you will know with the rest of the people.\" It wasn't just about withholding information—it was the way he said it, as if those without a title weren't worth his consideration. For Hisoka, control over information was another badge on his personal leaderboard, a demonstration of his elevated status, as if you need to have a higher score in his virtual leaderboard to access such information.\n\nThese were not isolated incidents. Hisoka's conversations became self-centered, only engaging if the topic involved his personal achievements, his leadership role, or his \"importance.\" If the discussion didn't revolve around his perceived successes, he was disinterested. His ego inflated, not from genuine growth or contribution, but from the mere acquisition of a title. The leadership position, in his mind, had boosted his rank, solidifying an illusion of superiority. The same people he used to hang out with now felt like extras in a story where he was the main character. He wasn't exactly chasing power for its own sake, but once he got it, he treated people differently—only respecting those who could potentially benefit his own climb up the metaphorical leaderboard. *But will Hisoka finally reach the top of his leaderboard?*\n\n*\"This approach mirrors a 'leaderboard' mentality, where the goal is to climb the ranks and gain status, much like in an app or game, rather than to genuinely contribute.\"*\n\n## The SPOTLIGHT:\n\nHisoka was always drawn to the loudest applause, the brightest lights. Even as a regular student, he found ways to make sure his voice was heard, his ideas acknowledged, often dominating group discussions or volunteering for public presentations. They thrived on the attention, the fleeting moments when all eyes were on them. But it was never truly about the project; it was about the audience. When a leadership role became available, like leading the school's summer camp, Hisoka didn't see it as a chance to organize a great event for his peers. He saw it as the ultimate stage. He imagined himself at the flag and all the sophomores circling around him asking him for help, he saw it as the chance to put him inside the **spotlight**.\n\nFor them, leadership wasn't about guiding; it was about **being seen**, about being admired, about having all eyes on them. The title was merely the spotlight operator, ensuring they were always illuminated. They would volunteer for tasks that offered maximum visibility, even if they weren't the most impactful or necessary. During meetings, they would steer conversations back to their contributions, ensuring their name was associated with every success. If someone else received praise, they would subtly interject with their own role in the achievement, diverting the attention back to themself. This constant need for validation, for the glow of the spotlight, meant that the true purpose of leadership—serving others—was overshadowed by their insatiable hunger for personal recognition. *But can true leadership ever flourish when its primary motivation is the applause of the crowd?*\n\n*\"This perspective views leadership as a stage for personal acclaim, where the desire for attention eclipses the actual work of guiding and serving.\"*\n\n## The MINISTER:\n\nThere was a time when a group project was spiraling out of control, and Hisoka, though not the actual leader, quickly stepped in. But his \"help\" wasn't collaborative. He didn't ask for ideas; he dictated tasks. He didn't facilitate discussion; he issued commands. If someone suggested an alternative, he would dismiss it with a dismissive wave or a sharp retort, asserting his way as the only way. He believed that only through his strict guidance could chaos be averted.\n\nWhen he finally gained an official leadership position, this tendency intensified. For Hisoka, leadership wasn't about empowering a team; it was about **exerting absolute control, like being the minister**, about ensuring that every piece moved exactly as he commanded. He micro-managed every detail, insisted on approving every decision, and grew visibly agitated if anyone deviated from his precise instructions. He viewed delegation not as trust, but as a necessary evil to be managed with an iron fist. He would withhold information he deemed \"unnecessary\" for others to know, or change plans at the last minute without consultation, all to maintain his grip on every aspect of the project. He believed that if he could control everything, he could control his own anxieties and the unpredictable nature of the world around him. But in doing so, he stifled creativity, eroded trust, and ultimately, alienated those he was supposed to lead. But does his approach of controlling everyone and everything actually expand the impact or just limit it more?\n\n*\"This mentality transforms leadership into a tool for dominance, prioritizing rigid control over collaboration and empowerment, ultimately hindering true progress.\"*\n\n## Leadership as an Outcast's Pursuit:\n\nBut here's the fundamental flaw, the specific \"bug\" in Hisoka's understanding that mocks the actual meaning of leadership: even after securing his leadership position, *did he feel truly fulfilled? Did he finally feel like he had proven himself? Or did he just keep chasing more, because deep down, the insecurity never left, the leaderboard always had another higher rank to achieve, the spotlight could always shine brighter, and there was always something more to control?*\n\nThis is the heartbreaking truth: **leadership, when seen as a mask for insecurity, a game for status, a stage for personal glory, or a means of absolute control, inevitably makes the \"leader\" an outcast**. Hisoka, in his relentless pursuit of titles, validation, attention, and dominance, distanced himself from genuine connection. He alienated those who once cared for him, transforming friendships into transactional relationships based on perceived utility. His focus on self-importance, his need for control, and his hunger for the spotlight made him incapable of truly listening, empathizing, or collaborating—the very cornerstones of effective leadership. He became isolated on his self-constructed pedestal, respected (if at all) for his position, but not for his character or his true impact.\n\nTrue leaders don't need titles to feel worthy. They don't need to prove their value by stepping on others or holding information. They don't see their peers as competitors or rungs on a ladder. Instead, they lead because they want to help, to empower others, to contribute to something larger than themselves. They understand that leadership isn't a solitary ascent to the top of an \"apps leadership board,\" nor is it a personal performance or a means to dominate. It is a shared journey where genuine connection, service, and collaboration create lasting impact. When leadership becomes about self-gratification—whether to hide insecurities, climb a social ladder, bask in the spotlight.\n\nSo, the question for us, and for characters like Hisoka, remains:\n\n*\"Does one lead because they are truly capable and committed to a cause, or do they lead because, without the title, they feel like they are not enough?\"*"
